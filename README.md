# Student_Alcohol_Consumption

This project involves an exploratory data analysis and various analysis techniques performed on a dataset of math students. The goal was to investigate the relationship between different variables and understand their impact on alcohol consumption and grades.

## Methods Used:

Data cleaning and subset selection: The dataset was prepared by removing irrelevant variables and ensuring data quality.
Data visualization: Visual techniques such as heatmaps and bar plots were employed to explore variable correlations and relationships.
Linear regression: Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between a parent's education and grades.
K-nearest neighbors: K-nearest neighbors analysis was performed to investigate if a student's first period grade and their father's education level can predict their alcohol consumption.
K-means clustering: Clustering technique was used to identify patterns and groupings in the dataset.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the principal components that explain the most variance.

## Conclusion

The analysis conducted on the math student dataset revealed that there is no strong correlation or apparent pattern between a student's alcohol consumption and their parent's education level and grades. The linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, and clustering analyses did not yield significant results. PCA showed that the data can be summarized effectively with a few principal components, indicating that further complex analyses may not be necessary.

The limitations of the project include the nature of the dataset, which lacked continuous variables and limited the depth of analysis. Although the results were not as expected, the project provided a valuable learning experience. Future research could explore additional datasets or consider different variables to uncover more insightful findings.
